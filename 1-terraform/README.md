To perform terraform code challange i have picked cloud provide Google Cloud Platform. Further **for example** below assumptions have been made:

1. GCP Project is already created.
2. VPCs, Subnets and secondary IP ranges for pods and services already created.
3. The code should serve to deploy kubernetes cluster and database instances in 3 different environments (dev/stage/prod)
